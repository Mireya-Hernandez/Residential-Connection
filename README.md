# Residential-Connection
The Residential Connection project is one I developed for my Software Specification course during my junior in college. The Software Specification course covered topics related to the analysis of software requirements, and the study of requirement engineering tools and techniques. For the project I was able to identify a business I wanted to work with for the semester. This project not only allowed me to learn about software specification, I also gain a bit of skilled experience in eliciting requirements, researching, developing user diagrams, creating a mockup, and organizing the information obtain into formal documents. For the project I use Jira Software and Confluence to store information pertaining to the project. In the end I had developed a Business Requirement Specification (BRS) report, a Software Requirement Document (SRD) and the Software Specification Requirement (SRS) report.
